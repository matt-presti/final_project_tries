## Final Prject: Trie with terminal based Visualizer


**Data Structure: Trie**

This is a trie/prefix tree data structure implementation in c++. The code defines node structure to have a flag to mark the end of words, charaters at the main data variable, and a map of key,value pairs of children in the form (character,pointer to node). I employed depth first search to drive the operations on the trie including insertion, lookup, and autocomplete. Tries are defined a class objects with public memeber functions. The visualization is terminal based and also operates on a depth first search logic by traversing down the tree instead of across. Test driven development was used to verify trie structure implementation. Below is a link to a video walk through explaining the structure and demoing the user interface.
